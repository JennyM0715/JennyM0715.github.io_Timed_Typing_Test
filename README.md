Created a Timed Typing Test application for my CIT 384 course using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

# Functions:

    - Match the text entered with the provided text on the page. Notify user of progress
    - Proper Event listeners for keyboard and button input
    - Start Over button clears input text, changes default notification, and sets clock to zero.

# Code Editors used:
    - Visual Studio Code with Live Server Extension (to see output as you code)
    - Notepad++
    - glitch  
        = an alternative instead of using Visual Studio Code
